In the project, the api test of the spotify application was made. Before starting the project, a new app should be created by following the steps on https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/.          

After the app is created, authorization should be done by following the names on the https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/ page.
